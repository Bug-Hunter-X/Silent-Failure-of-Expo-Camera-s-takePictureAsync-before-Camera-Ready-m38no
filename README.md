# Silent Failure of Expo Camera's takePictureAsync

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's Camera API where `takePictureAsync` fails silently if called before the camera is fully initialized. The issue is that the `onCameraReady` callback isn't always reliable in signaling readiness.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe that the app may fail to take a picture without any error messages.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing robust error handling and ensuring that `takePictureAsync` is only called after the camera is confirmed ready. This might involve using a state variable to track camera readiness and preventing picture capture attempts until the ready state is set.
